# Control-Engineering-in-TF

This folder contains two iPython notebooks: /n
AdiabaticControl.ipynb - written by sahandtabtab, which demonstrates a simple control problem of finding single qubit adiabatic inversion sequence using smooth waveforms conprised of even and odd polynomials /n
TF_GRAPE.ipynb - written by holgerhaas, which demonstrates a simple control problem of finding singe qubit pi pulse robust to control amplitude variations using smooth waveforms conprised of Legendre polynomials /n
